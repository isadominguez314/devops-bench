"""Run the agent-under-test inside a container with a scoped view of the world.

Ambient CLI agents inherit the operator's filesystem and environment: the
benchmark's answer material, cloud credentials, admin kubeconfig. This module
is the boundary. The container sees the per-run workspace at ``/workspace``
(``HOME`` under it), the task's seeded fixtures, a single-cluster kubeconfig
read-only at ``/creds/kubeconfig``, and a deny-filtered env overlay passed as
name-only ``-e`` flags. A sandbox that cannot be built raises
:class:`~devops_bench.core.errors.SandboxError` rather than running ambient.

The container is bridge-attached; what it may reach on the host is governed by
the host's ``DOCKER-USER`` rules (bastion setup), not here. The kubeconfig's
credential is the scoped ServiceAccount token from
:mod:`devops_bench.k8s.agent_credentials`; the model credential comes from
:mod:`devops_bench.core.model_providers`.
