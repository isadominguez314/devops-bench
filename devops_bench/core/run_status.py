"""When a run's end state cannot be attributed to the agent.

One definition, read by both the scoring layer (which withholds the composite)
and the row layer (which withholds the published correctness). Mirroring it
would let the leaderboard's correctness column disagree with the score beside
it, which is how a dead agent published a perfect 1.0 in the first place.

    """Whether ``record`` describes a run the agent never really performed.

    Two signals, because the status alone is not enough. Records produced by
    this lineage stamp ``status: "success"`` even when the agent call failed
    (a 429, an SDK fault, a timeout): the harness treats the *record* as
    successfully produced and marks the run un-``validated`` instead. So a
    status check alone would protect only artifacts from older builds while
    the next campaign reintroduced the same defect through a different door.

    The second signal is the one the harness itself uses for ``validated``:
    errors recorded and no trajectory at all means nothing the agent did can
    be read from the run, so whatever the cluster looks like now is not its
    doing. Errors *with* a trajectory are ordinary — an agent that hit a
    transient fault and carried on is still being graded on work it did.

    Args:
        record: One execution-result record.

    Returns:
        ``True`` when no composite score or published correctness may be
        derived from this record.
